## What is Utterances?

On the previous iteration of my blog, I defaulted to use the Disqus plugin readily available in the Hugo ecosystem. This time I wanted a less bloated alternative and stumbled upon [Utterances](https://utteranc.es), a lightweight and open source GitHub comments widget built on GitHub issues.

Under the hood, the widget is linked to a public repository, which can be your blog's own repository if it is public, or an independent one if you prefer to keep the rest of your code private or if you wish to keep your blog comments separate from your blog's other issues. The `utterances-bot` creates an issue for each page where there are comments, and then appends each comment to this issue. As you might have guessed, any reader who wishes to post a comment has to sign-in to a GitHub account (which should not be too hard a constraint if your audience is mainly developers).

## Integrate Utterances to your Gatsby blog

Follow the simple instructions on the [official documentation](https://utteranc.es/). You can configure the title of the issues that the `utterances-bot` will create, and choose a theme that matches your blog (seven available as of the date of writing). Depending on your configuration, you should end up with a script...

```html
<script
  src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
  repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
  issue-term="pathname"
  theme="github-light"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async
></script>
```

...which is unfortunately not copy-pastable as is, since React does not support the `<script>` tag. There are dark ways to go around this, but a more elegant solution would be to implement it _the React way_; let's write a component!

    target="_blank"

```js
// src/components/comments.js

import React, { useEffect } from "react";

const COMMENTS_ID = "comments-container";

const Comments = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://utteranc.es/client.js";
    // Replace with the repo on which you configured Utterances
    script.setAttribute("repo", "[ENTER REPO HERE]");
    script.setAttribute("issue-term", "pathname");
    script.setAttribute("theme", "github-light");
    script.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
    script.async = true;

    const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
    if (comments) comments.appendChild(script);

    return () => {
      const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
      if (comments) comments.innerHTML = "";
    };
  }, []);

  return <div id={COMMENTS_ID} />;
};

export default Comments;
```

## Dynamically change the theme

As the created widget is actually an iframe, we cannot change its CSS properties ourselves directly. Another way to make its theme match your blog's is to add a toggle that will switch the theme according to the class of your `body` or `html` element, depending on how you implemented your dark theme toggle. For example, on this website, a "dark" class is added to the `body` element when you click on the sun/moon icon on the top right, which in turn triggers some color changes in my CSS file. Let's add a little bit of code to our component (see highlighted lines):

```js
// src/components/comments.js

import React, { useEffect } from "react";

const COMMENTS_ID = "comments-container";

const Comments = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const toggleDark = document.body.classList.contains("dark");

    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://utteranc.es/client.js";
    // Replace with the repo on which you configured Utterances
    script.setAttribute("repo", "[ENTER REPO HERE]");
    script.setAttribute("issue-term", "pathname");
    script.setAttribute("theme", toggleDark ? "icy-dark" : "github-light");
    script.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
    script.async = true;

    const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
    if (comments) comments.appendChild(script);

    return () => {
      const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
      if (comments) comments.innerHTML = "";
    };
  }, []);

  return <div id={COMMENTS_ID} />;
};

export default Comments;
```

Now if you import and use the `<Comments />` component in your blog post template (mine is at `src/templates/blog-post.js`, as yours should be if you've used the `gatsby-starter-blog`), it will indeed match the theme of the Utterances widget to your blog's theme, but **only on the blog posts's initial loading**. If you try to switch your theme while already on the blog post, it will not toggle a change in the comments widget. Let's correct this!

Below is an extract from my layout template, which is the skeleton that is loaded on each page, mainly containing the navigation bar and the footer. The `<DarkModeSwitch />` component is basically a glorified checkbox that keeps track of the currently selected theme. We will make use of the `iframe.contentWindow.postMessage()` method, which enables to send a "message" directly to the Utterances iframe content through [cross-window communication](https://javascript.info/cross-window-communication).

```js
// src/components/layout.js

<DarkModeSwitch
  checked={theme === "dark"}
  onChange={e => {
    toggleTheme(e ? "dark" : "light");
    const isComment = document.querySelector("iframe.utterances-frame");
    if (isComment) {
      const utterancesTheme = e ? "icy-dark" : "github-light";
      document
        .querySelector("iframe.utterances-frame")
        .contentWindow.postMessage(
          { type: "set-theme", theme: utterancesTheme },
          "https://utteranc.es/"
        );
    }
  }}
/>
```

When clicked, what the `<DarkModeSwitch />` component does is

1. It switches the theme class of our `body` element with the `toggleTheme()` function (defined elsewhere)
2. If there is an Utterances iframe in the current page, it sends a “message” to its content to set its theme accordingly

And voilà, you now have a fully functional `<Comments />` component that can bring a fully functional and themed comment system wherever you'd like!
